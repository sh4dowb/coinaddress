Crypto address generator from xpub


* Free software: MIT license


Features
--------

* generate addresses for multiple blockchains from extended public key (xpub)
* minimum dependency (it means security)
* CLI interface

Getting started
---------------

Install package using pip (prefer virtualenv)::

    pip install coinaddress

And you can start use provided CLI. Read help first::

    coinaddress --help

To generate 1000 addresses for bitcoin xpub from file (xpub should be a single line in this file)::

    cat xpub.txt | coinaddress bitcoin 0 -n 1000

To generate another bunch of addresses::

    cat xpub.txt | coinaddress bitcoin 1000 -n 1000

xpub can be passed with `--xpub` option but you should avoid this and prefer read from file for security reasons.

Using from code
---------------

You can use public python interface to convert addresses::

    from coinaddress import address_from_xpub
    address_from_xpub(
        network='bitcoin',
        xpub='<XPUB>',
        path='0/0'
    )
